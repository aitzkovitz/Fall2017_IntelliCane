# Intellicane App

## Synopsis

The **Intellicane App** is a tablet based Android application which analyzes data collected from patients in order to create visual representations of forces exerted on a special cane which contains sensors to produce the data.  

## Getting Started

In order to obtain a working copy of the project you will need to clone the repository on this github page. Our team used the GitHub desktop application to clone/update the project. The project is also meant to be opened and edited in the Android Studio IDE.

### Prerequisites
You will need to have the Android Studio IDE in order to open the project and work on it as intended. Also you will need to set up an emulator in Android Studio. We used the Android Virtual Device Manager (AVD) in Android Studio. The emulator can be set up by navigating in Android Studio:

Tools -->Android-->AVD Manager -->Create Virtual Device 

- Make sure to select **Tablet** from the "Category" list then choose a specfic device to emulate.
- We chose the Nexus 10 API 25 with Android 7.1.1


### Installation

Once the repository has been cloned to your local machine you will simply need to open the project in Android Studio. In order to run and test the app on your machine you will need to set up a device emulator.
